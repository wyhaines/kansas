# Kansas

Kansas is an object-releational mapping library for Ruby. It has been around and in use since 2004 in many production projects, but has received very little open source exposure in that time, being used almost exclusively in closed source commercial projects.

Kansas's original design leveraged DBI, and provided an ORM mapping with a ruby based query syntax.

I am putting it on github, and starting the repo with a version of kansas from circa 2006-2007ish times. It will then be updated with a somewhat newer version that implements a few minor changes. The library will be converted to a modern Ruby packaging structure, and modernized.
